## Incident Management Lifecycles by Skill Level

| Lifecycle Stage          | Novice                               | Advanced Beginner                      | Competent                             | Proficient                                     | Expert                                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Identification          | Recognizes alerts based on clear indicators or rules; relies heavily on manuals and checklists. | Begins to identify patterns and contextual clues; still relies on guidance. | Able to recognize most incidents and differentiate between types. | Anticipates incidents from subtle network/security signals. | Instinctively detects incidents, often before alerts are triggered. |
| Logging                 | Follows prescribed formats and templates for incident records. | Logs incidents with basic categorization, sometimes asking for help. | Accurately logs with detailed info, understands importance of complete records. | Logs with precision, including cross-references to related events. | Creates and optimizes logging frameworks and automations. |
| Categorization          | Categorizes incidents according to clear-cut, predefined classes. | Develops some understanding of nuanced categories in network and security contexts. | Able to assign incidents to appropriate categories reliably. | Recognizes new or hybrid incident categories, suggests refinements. | Innovates categorization schemas adapting to evolving threats. |
| Prioritization          | Applies priority levels strictly by defined criteria. | Understands the impact of incidents but may mis-prioritize complex cases. | Consistently prioritizes incidents well according to business impact. | Balances multiple factors effectively to adjust priorities dynamically. | Strategically manages priorities aligning with organizational risk posture. |
| Containment             | Carries out containment steps as directed, with close oversight. | Begins to implement containment actions with some independent decision-making. | Executes containment strategies confidently and monitors effectiveness. | Designs containment plans adapted to incident context and severity. | Leads containment efforts innovatively to minimize impact and spread. |
| Investigation & Diagnosis | Uses diagnostic tools according to procedures; escalates unclear cases. | Applies basic analysis techniques, learning from experienced colleagues. | Independently investigates incident root causes within known scenarios. | Employs advanced analytics and cross-system correlations to diagnose complex incidents. | Masters forensic and threat hunting techniques to identify novel threats. |
| Resolution & Recovery   | Follows recovery procedures and checklists rigidly. | Participates in resolution steps, gaining familiarity with recovery processes. | Resolves common incident types and restores normal operations reliably. | Leads resolution efforts with creative solutions and coordinated recovery. | Drives continuous improvement in resolution strategies, minimizing downtime. |
| Post-Incident Review   | Completes after-action reports with supervisor input. | Provides input and learns from reviews; applies lessons in future incidents. | Independently conducts reviews and contributes to knowledge sharing. | Leads thorough reviews, identifies systemic weaknesses, and drives improvements. | Champions organizational learning and resilience through strategic reviews. |

This model provides a framework for analyzing and developing incident management skills for networking and security professionals across the full lifecycle of incidents. It can be used for training, assessment, and process improvement.
